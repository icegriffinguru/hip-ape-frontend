                        <p>Successful entrepreneurs, celebrities, marketing veterans and world-renowned digital artists are now working together to help answer that question.</p>
                        <p>At the end of December 2021, all fates will be decided.</p>
                        <p>As that’s the date the Prime Ape Planet sends out its first ever VIP invitations.</p>
                        <p>And you’d be wise to snatch one for yourself and everyone you care about. Because once this collection of 7979 unique NFTs mint? </p>
                        <p>But early supporters of the project will be handsomely rewarded.</p>
                        <p>As masters of digital art, the art team behind Prime Ape Planet has enjoyed success in the “Old World.” Their work has always gained mainstream recognition and adaptation.</p>
                        <p>They’ve worked on titles such as The Lion King, Godzilla, and countless other animations… For industry household names including Marvel, Disney, and MGM among others.</p>
                        <p>Prime Ape Planet will be the project to plant their flags in the Metaverse.</p>
                        <p>Much like our offline culture, the NFT space won’t ever be the same after their contribution.</p>
                        <p>Join them before it’s too late on Discord:</p>
